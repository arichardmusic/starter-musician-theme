<p>Aaron Richard grew up in a house where music was oxygen. Between 6-year-old Aaron spending entire days belting out Garth Brooks albums, his older brothers filling their rooms with 3 Doors Down or Gin Blossoms, their dad strumming out b-sides from Journey discography in the living room, and their mom humming along with the radio on car rides, music proved to be as prominent in everyday life as food and water, and that prominence only crescendo-ed after Aaron learned his first guitar chord.</p>

<p>Now listening to Three Days Grace, Daughtry, Keith Urban, Skillet, and Zac Brown Band, all at the same time, 15-year-old Aaron discovered a newly rejuvenated current of music flowing through him, and it wasn't long before he was channeling the current onto notebook paper lines.</p>

<p>Out of high school, Aaron co-founded a three-piece band, entitled "2nd Hand Band", which released an EP in 2016, and played local shows from Atlanta to Athens for a handful of years. After the group disbanded in early 2018, Aaron set his sights on his first solo project, while releasing "Another Second Chance", a demo-track EP, in August 2018.</p>

<p>As the calendar year approached transition, in late 2018, Aaron hosted a semi-series on IGTV via his Instagram page, entitled "The Depression Sessions" (which later was revisited and released as a second EP in February 2019), consisting of 5 previously unveiled songs which sought to portray Aaron's emotional state and personal experiences of 2018, and the year was capped off with the self-produced single, "Get This New Year Over With", which further expounded on Aaron's story, and was written as a personal vow on Aaron's part to put stress and anxiety behind him, while focusing on a bigger and brighter future, starting with 2019.</p>

<p>Between opening for touring artist Chase Huglin at the Masquerade in Atlanta, GA, winning a local artists' competition in Cumming, GA (Music4Chief's "Rock 'N' Rumble"), qualifying for the finals in another in Woodstock, GA (MadLife Stage & Studio's "Local Artists Showcase"), Aaron has worked to establish himself as a contributor to the local music scene in Northeast GA, and in September 2019 released his first studio quality full-length LP, entitled "Icarus", working in collaboration with Kyle Barnes of Broadwaybarnes Music Production and Greg Hendler of GMH Audio, featuring 12 tracks, ranging from the depths of emotional distress to the celebration of it, among other various sub-themes.</p>
